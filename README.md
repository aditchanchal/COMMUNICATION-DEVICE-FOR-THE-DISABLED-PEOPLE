# COMMUNICATION DEVICE FOR THE DISABLED PEOPLE
Gesture Detection Based Device for the Disabled


# Introduction
Science and Technology have made Human life addictive to comfort but still there exists an
underprivileged group of people who are fighting for finding an innovative way that can
make the process of communication easier for them. According to the World Health
Organization, about 285 million people in the world are blind, 300 million are deaf and 1
million are dumb. According to census 2011, In India there are 1,640,868 citizens who can’t
speak as well as 1,261,722 citizens who can’t listen. More than 70% of Deaf population of
India is working in Government as well as Private sectors. For communication they are
dependent on Sign Languages. In India most popularly Indian Sign Language is used. In rest
of the population of India very few citizens are able to use Indian Sign Language, as they
really don’t need to learn sign language. This causes a communication barrier between Deaf
Dumb and Normal person. This leads to disqualification of hearing impaired from main
stream of the society. To overcome this problem a communication assistant is required, to
convert Sign Language to auditory speech. Round the world people who are deaf, mute or
blind find it hard to communicate normally with people. This project investigates a new way
that can be productize so that a new gadget can be developed that can bridge the gap in
communication among differently abled people who suffer from any of the possible
combinations of the disability of Blindness, Deafness and Dumbness. For this we are looking
for some sort of wearable technology that can satisfy our purpose. The device focuses on
eliminating this problem by providing a tool to assist the communication. Our target
population is mostly well versed with ASL (American Sign Language) which is the
convention followed worldwide. The device has a dataset loaded with words and alphabets
that can be invoked by hand symbols/signs. The dataset can be altered by the user providing
him/her with the option of personalizing the tool and enhancing the experience and utility.

# Abstract
In this project, we are going to propose a new wearable communication device in an effort to
bridge the gap in the process of communication between the Blind, Deaf and Dumb people.
The prototype will make use of the flex sensor and Arduino microcontroller to provide a
means of communication to differently-abled people having one or all of the above mention
disabilities. It is assumed that a person who is deaf is also dumb but vice versa is not true. The
device can convert the hand gestures to desired letter/word/phrase and then display it on a
16*2 LCD as well as can send this letter/word/phrase to a mobile device using wireless
communication for conversion of text to speech.
